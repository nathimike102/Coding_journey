JAVA 1:
James Goseling...WORA (write once, run anywhere)

Java Creation and Running without IDE:
	create a file with extention .java
	write some code
	complilation:
	javac filename.java
	--> creation of byte code (.class)

	Run (Execution):
	java classname
	
Conventions in Java:	
	1. Class, interface
		Are always title case
		System --> Class
		String --> Class
		ActionListener --> interface
	2. Variable (nouns)

		1. if there is only one word, all lowercase
		2. if there is more than one word, 
				first word --> lowercase, 
				from there Every word's first letter is Capital
	3. Method (function) (verbs)
		Are always camel case
		1. if there is only one word, all lowercase
		2. if there is more than one word, 
				first word --> lowercase, 
				from there Every word's first letter is Capital
		eg. helloWorld, thisIsNathiFromThub
	4. constants
